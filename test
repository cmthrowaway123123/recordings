Intro:
-Clear indications of having my internal monologue read, starting around 5pm Christmas eve, 2021
-I now believe I was gassed or something on Hammond St, and had multiple devices injected under my scalp, or possibly deeper into my head
-I seem to have been followed from North Bay to London, and am being harassed daily

Symptoms:
-Playing my internal monologue through the walls
-Reading my internal monologue out loud to me
-Responding to, and interrupting my internal monologue
-Daily ringing in ears, which is more frequent and intense when I am thinking in depth on something.
-Using the mini fridge and other appliances to speak. (I have recordings of this)
-Talking through speakers and headset when there is audio already playing
-Audio echoing directly into my head
    -something extremely loud, to the point I feared for my life. Imagine speakers next to your head on full volume and someone screaming at you.
    -other times it is barely noticeable
    -they will play drums on loop with the tempo constantly changing, while I am trying to sleep
    -if I wear ear plugs, this is how they harass me
-Constant use of voice modifiers, including my own voice
-Interference with closed eye visuals. Preventing myself from visualizing, and possibly injecting imagery.
-A tingling feeling in my head and teeth sometimes
    -in one very intense instance, the room light seemed to change color, and some plaque fell off my teeth including one very large chunk. I over heard someone say "holy shit, you're going to kill him"
-Constant shaking of the floor, especially when I'm trying to sleep. I'm 100% sure this is them, and not a change in blood pressure or something from laying down.
-Quick and sharp bursts of "static" in my head. This are extremely effective at interrupting my train of thought.
-Constant interruption of thought and harassment through all the above means

Summary:
-All of this gets used daily to harass me non-stop
-When it comes to drawing, they will comment on what I'm doing. If I'm about to draw an important line, they will quickly jerk the floor, etc
-If I'm listening to music, they will shake the floor, and echo a loud ringing into my headphones until I have a headache
-If I'm trying to sleep, they will shake the floor, echo audio directly into my head, and do basically everything possible to keep me awake
-When I was working, there were many nights I got no sleep due to them
-If I am programming they will do all of the above, and talk crap if I make any mistakes
-I am worried to create, or to do anything, because I don't know what they are learning from it, and how I am inspiring them
-I have at times been extremely frustraited, and they seemed to enjoy this with child like giddiness

Apartment 5
1305 Hammond St.
North Bay, Ontario
P1B 2J2
-Initially there were signs Randy (employee downstairs) and Danial St Jean (neightbour in apartment 4) of them spying on me, but I didn't care as much as I should have. It was more subtle like clearing throats at weird times, or seeming to comment / respond to what I was doing
-A new neightbour Kevin Foreman moved into apartment 6, immediately began harassing me, and intentionally causing every problem possible. I later found out he seemed to be related to Randy
-One night I woke up very groggy and out of it, and the item I used to block / lock my door had been knocked free
-After this I had multiple instances of being stalked by Kevin Foreman, and filed a police report.
-In one instance, Randy got extremely upset with his secretary and knocked her out cold. Others could be heard out back shortly after laughing about the instance. I offered to file a police report with my witness account, but was not taken up on the offer
-I think I may have heard Randy torturing the landlore Rob Fiddler. I didn't think it was real at the time, but I regret now not taking it more seriously.
-The landlord Rob Fiddler seemed to be getting ganged up on by a business competitor. His business Promus I believe got bought out by Total Cleaning and Restoration. There was a lot of tension over this, and I believe Randy helped sabatoge Rob
-I had what I thought at the time was a mini stroke, but I now believe was an attack of some sort. I felt an intense pressure in my head, and felt very light headed. I heard Randy downstairs say "Uh oh, what's happening?" This injury has caused me much suffering over the past few years
-One instance where I passed out completely, seemingly out of nowhere, and another where I almost but didn't
-Having my teeth and head tingle / hurt. The light in the room seemed to change color and the fan was changing pace. Bits of plaque fell off my teeth, including one large chunk. I heard someone in the other room say "Holy shit, you're going to kill him"
-Non-stop harassment, including the floor shaking for a week straight, death threats, and having every single one of my showers messed with
