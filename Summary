Intro:
-Clear indications of having my internal monologue read, starting around 5pm Christmas eve, 2021
-I now believe I was gassed or something on Hammond St, and had multiple devices injected under my scalp, or possibly deeper into my head
-I seem to have been followed from North Bay to London, and am being harassed daily



Symptoms:
-Playing my internal monologue through the walls
-Reading my internal monologue out loud to me
-Responding to, and interrupting my internal monologue
-Daily ringing in ears, which is more frequent and intense when I am thinking in depth on something.
-Using the mini fridge and other appliances to speak. (I have recordings of this)
-Talking through speakers and headset when there is audio already playing
-Audio echoing directly into my head
    -something extremely loud, to the point I feared for my life. Imagine speakers next to your head on full volume and someone screaming at you.
    -other times it is barely noticeable
    -they will play drums on loop with the tempo constantly changing, while I am trying to sleep
    -if I wear ear plugs, this is how they harass me
-Constant use of voice modifiers, including my own voice
-Interference with closed eye visuals. Preventing myself from visualizing, and possibly injecting imagery.
-A tingling feeling in my head and teeth sometimes
    -in one very intense instance, the room light seemed to change color, and some plaque fell off my teeth including one very large chunk. I over heard someone say "holy shit, you're going to kill him"
-A constant sensation that the floor is shaking, especially when I'm trying to sleep. I'm %100 sure this is them, and not a change in blood pressure or something from laying down. However I don't know if it's actually the floor shaking, or them using whatever is in my head
-Quick and sharp bursts of "static" in my head. This are extremely effective at interrupting my train of thought.
-They are able to read my internal monologue while I'm outside, and are also able to inject audio to my head. The audio injected outside is much less clear than the audio from adjacent rooms, further suggesting adjacent audio is from a speaker
-Constant interruption of thought and harassment through all the above means



Summary:
-All of this gets used daily to harass me non-stop
-When it comes to drawing, they will comment on what I'm doing. If I'm about to draw an important line, they will quickly jerk the floor, etc
-If I'm listening to music, they will shake the floor, and echo a loud ringing into my headphones until I have a headache
-If I'm trying to sleep, they will shake the floor, echo audio directly into my head, and do basically everything possible to keep me awake
-When I was working, there were many nights I got no sleep due to them
-If I am programming they will do all of the above, and talk crap if I make any mistakes
-I am worried to create, or to do anything, because I don't know what they are learning from it, and how I am inspiring them
-I have at times been extremely frustraited, and they seemed to enjoy this with child like giddiness



Apartment 5
1305 Hammond St.
North Bay, Ontario
P1B 2J2
-Initially there were signs Randy (employee downstairs) and Danial St Jean (neightbour in apartment 4) of them spying on me, but I didn't care as much as I should have. It was more subtle like clearing throats at weird times, or seeming to comment / respond to what I was doing
-A new neightbour Kevin Foreman moved into apartment 6, immediately began harassing me, and intentionally causing every problem possible. I later found out he seemed to be related to Randy
-One night I woke up very groggy and out of it, and the item I used to block / lock my door had been knocked free
-After this I had multiple instances of being stalked by Kevin Foreman, and filed a police report.
-In one instance, Randy got extremely upset with his secretary and knocked her out cold. Others could be heard out back shortly after laughing about the instance. I offered to file a police report with my witness account, but was not taken up on the offer
-I think I may have heard Randy torturing the landlore Rob Fiddler. I didn't think it was real at the time, but I regret now not taking it more seriously.
-The landlord Rob Fiddler seemed to be getting ganged up on by a business competitor. His business Promus I believe got bought out by Total Cleaning and Restoration. There was a lot of tension over this, and I believe Randy helped sabatoge Rob
-When I purchased bell fiber internet, I attempted to do a wireless packet capture to see if anyone was messing with it when I set it up. Shortly after I started it, I heard Randy say from downstairs "See, I told you he was spying on us". For the record, I was never spying on them.
-I had what I thought at the time was a mini stroke, but I now believe was an attack of some sort. I felt an intense pressure in my head, and felt very light headed. I heard Randy downstairs say "Uh oh, what's happening?" This injury has caused me much suffering over the past few years
-One instance where I passed out completely, seemingly out of nowhere, and another where I almost but didn't
-Having my teeth and head tingle / hurt. The light in the room seemed to change color and the fan was changing pace. Bits of plaque fell off my teeth, including one large chunk. I heard someone in the other room say "Holy shit, you're going to kill him"
-Non-stop harassment, including the floor shaking for a week straight, death threats, and having every single one of my showers messed with



924 Premier Rd
North Bay, Ontario
P1A 2H5
-I moved in with my Nana and Dad. This was an attempt to both de-escalate, and to save some money to move again.
-I experienced head ringing here, and still had the feeling I was being spied on.
-In only one instance did I experience the floor shaking sensation, however it was very clearly the same.



Ramada Inn
817 Exeter Rd
London, Ontario
N6E 1W1
-I moved to London and was followed from North Bay
-When I first got here, about a week in, I was playing chess in my room, and heard the adjacent room discussing my moves
-There was a group of people outsite my room I over heard mention "North Bay". I later recognize these voices at Dundas st
-I reported a potential abuse incident to the police involving the adjacent room. The two neighbouring rooms suggested the noise was coming from elsewhere, discrediting my report. I now assume they were all part of the group who rented out 14 rooms on Dundas st
-I experienced a very intense tingling sort of pain. Hiding in the bathroom seemed to be the best place to avoid it
-After a month living here, I moved to 1555 Dundas st, into room 16, and they have followed me here as well



Room 16
1555 Dundas St
London, Ontario
N5W 3B8
-This is where I'm currently living, and dealing with the daily harassment
-At first things seemed to be good, however after a few months I started to experience the same floor shaking sensation I felt in North Bay at Hammond st
-There were other more subtle things, like every time I would put my headphones on, my neighbour would bang on the wall. I thought it was coincedence at first, but it became regular. It became more and more clear they were harassing me again
-I was sitting on my room one day, and the person who I recognized from Ramada opened my door with the buildings master key. They had apparently rented out 14 rooms, and were given the master key. At least one other individual reported an illegal room entry. I assume they compromised my computers at some point when I wasn't home. I also assume they compromised the entire building, and probably have a copy of the new master key.
-I heard what was potentially another abuse incident. I didn't report it because the individual did not seem in true danger. I believe it was another attempt to discredit me to the police
-On Christmas Eve 2021, I experience the first clear case of them reading and replying to my internal monologue.
    -The voices were of some individuals I had known online, and who had harassed me before.
    -I forget exactly what they were saying, but I seem to remember it mostly be stuff like "Hey fenxy. Yes were actually reading your thoughts." I was pretty panicked at the time, and I didn't really know what to do.
    -They seemed to be coming from speakers in the adjacent rooms. The individuals in both room 15 and 17 were not the same people who had been living in there for months prior. I could clearly hear people, and also audio from speakers next to the wall
    -This went on for about an hour, before my head began to ring very loudly. I felt the same light headed sensation from Hammond when I had passed out. I wasn't sure if they were gassing me, or using an EMR attack of some sort, so I opened my window and turned my fan on full. I also turned my space heater on full to use as much electricity as possible. I believe some dust from the unused part of the heater then burned creating a nasty smell, which might have set off the fire alarm. Maybe it was something they were doing, but I think it was the heater.
    -This caused the adjacent rooms to seemingly panic and leave their rooms. I could hear them talking outsite. I was worried they thought I was poisoning them, and I think they were playing on that to make me more worried.
    -I knew the building had a group of criminals in it who had the master key, and I wasn't sure if this group was related to them or not. I was worried they might be in danger. I went to bed early around 7-8pm, so I could wake up and listen for trouble during the night. I kind of expected to die, but I didn't know what else to do. There was no proof of anything, and if they could kill me there, they could follow me and kill me somewhere else too
    -I recall waking up around 3-4am. I didn't notice anything out of place until everyone else woke up. The individuals in the adjacent rooms were no longer there, and the previous individuals were back in there as if nothing happened.
    -This made me worried, so I called the police again. I explained the sittuation involving the master key, the 14 rooms being rented out, and the individuals who were no longer there in the morning. I left the mind reading part out
-For the record, I wasn't drinking or anything unusual. I had smoked a little marijuana, but nothing excessive.
-The next week or so was very odd. I continued to hear audio through the adjacent walls. It was very messy though. There was sounds of outside, and random conversations I couldn't fully understand. I believe there were some instances of people forgetting to mute their mics after harassing me. They would leave it unmuted then go outsite and talk with others.
-I assumed it would stop after a while, but it has continued daily since Dec 24th.
-They seem to be refining their techniques, and are getting more effective at harassing me. I believe I am starting to develope brain damage, as they further work out my nueral network
-I am %99 sure room 17 and 15 are involved. 15 moved in after I did, but 17 was here prior. They seem to know each other, and I've recorded audio from 17 that seems to correlate to my internal monologue at the time.
-Using my fridge to talk is currently their favorite method of audio harassment, as the audio source is right in my room. I am attempting to document this as much as possible
-My headaches are getting more frequent, and worse. I have a weird headache right now.
-I'm not sure what else to do. My goal is to just compile believeable evidence, and get a CT scan. I assume any CT results will be tampered with though.
